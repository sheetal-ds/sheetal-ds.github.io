              <strong>Description:</strong> Engage3 measures how consumers view retailers' prices and helps retailers optimize the prices they offer, curated for thousands of items, hundreds of locations and millions of customers.
            </p>
            <p>
              Proprietary Engage3 pricing model gave outputs such as Freeze the Price (No price change) or Change the price up by 20% , etc. There was a need of easy-to-understand metric, akin to a credit score, which would consolidate forecasting into customer-friendly scorecard rating
            </p>
            <p>
              I explored logistic regression, other classification techniques to perform this. The best method to achieve the validation score goal is by using a multi criteria decision making model - TOPSIS (Technique for Order of Preference by Similarity to Ideal Solution)
            </p>
            <p>
              Input to the model were error terms of the price forecast and other measures like number of data points used for prediction, price standard deviation, etc. And output was a validation score. By looking at this, customers of Engage3 would achieve more confident decision making (High score implies the retailer should incorporate the suggestion while low score suggests vice versa)
